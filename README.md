## Wifi Attack
ðŸ“¢JUST FOR EDUCATIONNAL PURPOSEðŸ“¢
>**Prerequisites**<br/>
>We need to have *hostpot* (wifi name (**ssid**)) available in this case we just  put sample password (**1234567890**)


To start open your terminal and type the command bellow : 
```console
ifconfig
``` 

 or
 
 ```console
iwconfig
```
 
 > Those commands allow you to list all network interface available and to apply the attack we focus on *wlan0* interface (wireless network)

This command stops network managers then kill interfering processes left <br/>
**Note:** It is very important to kill the network managers before putting a card in monitor mode!

```console
sudo airmon-ng check kill
```

Now we start *monitoring mode* on our card :
```console
start wlan0
```

Next<br/>

```console
sudo aireplay-ng -9 wlan0mon
```

So we have to use the ``wlan0mon`` interface to see all the access points around us and what is being done in these different access points.We see "Â **injection is working** " and we have the access points that are displayed. We are interested in the access point "TECNO SPARK 6 Air" and you see that each access point operates in a specific channel. For us it is ``channel 13``.
